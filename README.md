# Food Recommendation System

The Food Recommendation System is an innovative application that utilizes machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide personalized culinary suggestions based on user preferences. By analyzing a dataset containing attributes of various food items, the system generates recommendations tailored to the user's taste, dietary requirements, and past food choices.

## Features

- Data Loading: Load a dataset containing information about different types of food items.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleanse, standardize, and enhance the quality of the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting textual information.
- Feature Engineering: Combine relevant features of each food item into comprehensive feature vectors, including food name, category type, cuisine type, and dietary preferences.
- Text Processing and Vectorization: Preprocess textual data and transform it into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF vectorization.
- Similarity Calculation: Compute cosine similarity scores between pairs of food items to quantify their similarity.
- Recommendation Generation: Generate personalized recommendations based on user input, leveraging precomputed similarity scores to identify and prioritize similar food items.
- User Interaction: Interact with the system by inputting favorite dishes and receiving curated lists of recommended items.
- Feedback Mechanisms: Rate recommended dishes, provide comments, and refine preferences over time to improve recommendation accuracy.
